                    is one of the most dog-friendly destinations on California's Central Coast, with
                    a dedicated off-leash dog beach, miles of scenic trails, and a welcoming
                    community that treats dogs like the VIPs they are.

                  Tips for Traveling with Pets to the Central Coast
                </h2>

                    A pet-friendly vacation on the Central Coast is easier than you might think.
                    Here are a few tips to help you and your dog make the most of your trip:
                  </p>
                  <ol className="space-y-3">
                    <li>
                      <strong>Book early.</strong> Pet-friendly vacation rentals in Avila Beach are
                      in high demand, especially during summer months and holiday weekends. Reserve
                      your stay well in advance to secure the best dates.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <strong>Pack the essentials.</strong> Bring your dog's food, leash, favorite
                      toys, and any medications. While we provide water bowls and waste bags,
                      having familiar items from home helps your pet settle in faster.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <strong>Know the local rules.</strong> Avila Beach Dog Beach (at the west end
                      of the main beach) allows off-leash dogs, but dogs must be leashed on the
                      main beach area. The Bob Jones Trail also requires leashes.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <strong>Plan for the weather.</strong> Central Coast weather is generally
                      mild, but summer days can get warm. Bring extra water for your pup and
                      plan beach time for mornings or late afternoons when the sand is cooler.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <strong>Scout vet services.</strong> The Central Coast has excellent
                      veterinary clinics in nearby San Luis Obispo and Pismo Beach. Save a local
                      vet's number in your phone, just in case.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <strong>Explore beyond the beach.</strong> Take your dog on a wine country
                      drive (many Edna Valley tasting rooms have dog-friendly patios), visit Avila
                      Valley Barn, or hike the trails at Montana de Oro State Park.
