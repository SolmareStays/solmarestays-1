    question: 'What is there to do in Arroyo Grande and the surrounding area?',
    answer: 'Arroyo Grande is the gateway to Central Coast wine country. Visit award-winning wineries in the Edna Valley and Arroyo Grande Valley AVAs, explore the charming Village of Arroyo Grande with its antique shops and restaurants, hike at Lopez Lake, or drive 15 minutes to Pismo Beach or 20 minutes to Avila Beach. The area offers a perfect blend of wine country relaxation and coastal adventure.',
  },
  {
    question: 'How far is Arroyo Grande from the beach?',
    answer: 'Arroyo Grande is approximately 15 minutes from Pismo Beach and 20 minutes from Avila Beach by car. Oceano Dunes, where you can drive and ride ATVs on the beach, is about 15 minutes away. The area is perfectly positioned between wine country and the coast, giving you the best of both worlds.',
  },
  {
    question: 'What wineries are near Arroyo Grande?',
    answer: 'The Arroyo Grande Valley and neighboring Edna Valley are home to dozens of world-class wineries. Talley Vineyards and Chamisal Vineyards are both nearby, along with Laetitia Vineyard & Winery, Saucelito Canyon, Claiborne & Churchill, and Timbre Winery in the AG Village. The region is known for exceptional pinot noir, chardonnay, and sparkling wines.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Is Arroyo Grande good for group trips and retreats?',
    answer: 'Absolutely. Our Casitas Estate in Arroyo Grande is specifically designed for groups — it sleeps up to 14 guests across six king suites on seven private acres. With a pool, hot tub, bocce court, and walking trails, it is ideal for family reunions, corporate retreats, wedding parties, and milestone celebrations. The wine country setting and proximity to beaches make it a uniquely versatile group destination.',
  },
  {
    question: 'What is the weather like in Arroyo Grande?',
    answer: 'Arroyo Grande enjoys a Mediterranean climate with warm, dry summers and mild winters. Summer temperatures range from 75-90 degrees Fahrenheit — typically warmer than the immediate coast due to its inland valley location. Spring and fall are beautiful with comfortable temperatures in the 65-80 degree range. Winters are mild at 50-65 degrees. The area gets more sunshine than the foggy coastal towns.',
  },
  {
    question: 'What is the Village of Arroyo Grande?',
    answer: 'The Village of Arroyo Grande is a charming historic downtown centered on Branch Street. It features a famous swinging bridge over Arroyo Grande Creek, antique shops, art galleries, locally owned restaurants like Rooster Creek Tavern and Mason Bar Mixed Grill, and a walkable small-town atmosphere. The Village hosts seasonal events including the Harvest Festival and holiday celebrations.',

                    Arroyo Grande sits in the heart of California's Central Coast wine country — a rolling landscape of
                    vineyards, oak-studded hills, and some of the best pinot noir and chardonnay in the state. Unlike the
                    crowded tasting rooms of Napa, the Arroyo Grande and Edna Valley wine regions offer an intimate,
                    unhurried experience where winemakers still pour for you personally and the views stretch uninterrupted
                    to the Pacific.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    What makes Arroyo Grande uniquely appealing is its position between wine country and the coast. You can
                    spend the morning hiking at Lopez Lake, the afternoon tasting wines at Talley Vineyards or Laetitia, and
                    be sitting on the sand at Pismo Beach by sunset — all within a 15-minute drive. Downtown San Luis Obispo,
                    with its restaurants, Thursday Night Farmers Market, and university-town energy, is just 10 minutes north.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Our Casitas Estate in Arroyo Grande takes this location and elevates it into something extraordinary:
                    seven private acres of vineyard-lined grounds, a 3,700 square foot main house, five private casitas each
                    with a king bed and fireplace, a pool, hot tub, bocce court, and walking trails — all reserved exclusively
                    for your group. Talley and Chamisal vineyards are nearby. It is one of the most beloved private estates on
                    the Central Coast, and it is now managed by Solmaré Stays.

                    The Arroyo Grande Valley and Edna Valley wine regions are among California's most exciting wine
                    destinations. Cooled by ocean breezes from nearby Pismo Beach and Avila Beach, these valleys produce
                    wines with a character distinct from warmer inland regions — bright acidity, complex flavors, and an
                    elegance that has earned the area recognition from wine critics worldwide.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Chamisal Vineyards, one of the original Edna Valley plantings, offers exceptional chardonnay and pinot noir
                    in a beautiful hilltop setting near our Casitas Estate property. Talley Vineyards, one of the region's most
                    celebrated producers, is a short drive south and offers tastings overlooking their organic vineyards.
                    Laetitia Vineyard and Winery specializes in sparkling wines and pinot noir, with a beautiful tasting
                    room and patio.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    For those who want to venture further, Paso Robles — one of California's largest and most diverse wine
                    regions — is 30-40 minutes north. With over 200 wineries specializing in bold reds, Rhone varietals, and
                    innovative blends, Paso Robles offers a perfect day trip from Arroyo Grande. Many wine tour companies
                    will pick up directly from the estate.

                    Our flagship Arroyo Grande property is the Casitas Estate — a seven-acre wine country compound that
                    sleeps up to 14 guests across six private king suites. The estate features a 3,700 square foot Main
                    House with a full commercial kitchen, bar, and dining room that seats the entire group, plus five
                    private casitas scattered across the grounds, each with its own king bed, fireplace, and en-suite bathroom.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The grounds are designed for gathering and relaxation. A private pool and hot tub sit surrounded by
                    vineyard views with no neighbors in sight. A full-size bocce court is tucked into the landscape for
                    afternoon tournaments. Walking trails wind through the full 13 acres, past oak trees and working
                    vines, offering the kind of space and privacy that simply does not exist at a hotel or resort.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The Casitas Estate is ideal for family reunions, corporate retreats, wedding parties, and milestone
                    celebrations. It is a whole-estate booking — all six suites, the Main House, pool, hot tub, bocce court,
                    and all 13 acres are reserved exclusively for your group. No other guests, no shared spaces, no
                    schedules imposed on you.
